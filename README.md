# The Room

### Unique Features:

* Unlike most text-adventure games, one can enter for example "look at the bed over there" and other unexpected inputs and they'll still work! It actually feels intuitive!
* Has an inventory system that allows one to pick up and use items found along the way to solve each puzzle.
